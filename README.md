Egglist is a wordlist generator writting in C++ that can generate wordlists quickly and with a lot of customization.

I wrote this application during a security class I was taking when I couldn't find a wordlist generator that was flexible
enough to meet my needs. I originally wrote this utility in Java but when I found that it used a ton of memory, I rewrote 
it in C++ using only the standard libraries for maximum portability. It has a small memory footprint and is blazing fast.
